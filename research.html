                     Unemployment insurance and cigarette smoking

                        [Abstract] We provide evidence for the causal relationship between unemployment insurance (UI) and individuals’ smoking behavior using the 1995–2011 Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement data. Our identification relies on the exploitation of the exogenous variations of the maximum UI weekly benefits across states and over years. Instead of focusing on all unemployed people, we concentrate on those who are eligible for UI benefits. We find that when the maximum UI weekly benefit level increases by $100, smoking cessation increases by approximately 2.9 percentage points among the UI-eligible unemployed. The results are robust to various model specifications. We also explore the mechanism and find suggestive evidence that the increase in the maximum UI weekly benefit leads to a decrease in the probability of over-work of the respective spouse. Moreover, the unemployed who are less educated are more responsive to the increasing UI benefits.

                        Unintended Policy Consequence: Migration Control Policy in Mega Cities in China and Parent-Children Separation 
                  </h3> Yuanyuan Chen and Wei Fu, current draft July 2019. 
                  <h4 class = "abstract">
                        [Abstract] Large cities in China have started to implement population control policies since 2014. Using difference-in-difference estimation with the data of the Chinese Migrant Dynamic Monitoring Survey from 2011 to 2015, we find that increase in the population control enforcement in large cities causes children of rural to urban migrant workers who work in these cities to be more likely left behind. The effect is robust to alternative measures of population control enforcement intensification, to the definition of children left behind, as well as to some identification tests accounting for the pre-existing trend tests and the self-selection of parent migration choice. This impact is primarily driven by increasing the education enrollment requirement in 2014 in large cities and is more pronounced for families with lower social-economic status and children at school entrance age.

                           Technology Development, Labor Migration and Family Integration: Evidence from China’s High-Speed Railway Development
                     </h3> Hui Cao, Shin-Yi Chou, Wei Fu, current draft Dec 2018. 
                     <h4 class = "abstract">
                           [Abstract] As radical High-Speed Railway (HSR) network has been constructing since 2008, the ultra-city transportation cost drops significantly. In this paper, we investigate how the development in transportation technology changes adult children’s job allocation decision as well as the family integration. Drawn on the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, we construct a Difference-in-Difference model utilizing the timing variation of the city’s first HSR station open date. We find that the HSR connection contributes to approximately 2.8% increase in the probability of children’s frequently visiting elder parent, and also increase the probability of children’s work outside their parent’s county by 30%. These findings show that the development in transportation technology expand an individual’s job options and substantially changes the family dynamics.                     </h4>
